      <p>Many people visit Ladakh looking for an encounter and experience with Buddha Dhamma, its monks, nuns and monasteries. But for those yearning for a still deeper and meaningful understanding of inner peace the language and cultural difference presents a serious challenge. Most seekers, having arrived in Leh, find it difficult to locate suitable English speaking Dhamma and meditation teachers. </p>

      <p>Mahabodhi is one the few centers in Ladakh offering regular Meditation courses, Dhamma talks and books - literature on meditation and yoga sessions.</p>

      <p>Being about 10 kms from Leh city, the Devachan Campus is out of the way for many visitors to Ladakh. MIMC rents a small building at Changspa, to offer its services to those who make Leh their base. The Changspa sub-centre is well away from the main Leh bazaar and is not too noisy. Here, regular daily meditation classes and Dhamma talks are conducted from June to September during peak tourist season. </p>

      <p>Daily yoga and meditation classes are also conducted at the Mahabodhi City Centre, Changspa from Monday to Saturday. </p>
