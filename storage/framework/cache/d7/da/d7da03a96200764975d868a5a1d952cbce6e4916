      <p>Health care and medical development in Ladakh is very poor and many people in the remote areas cannot effort to buy medicine or get proper treatments. Doctors in Ladakh are very rare and many people die or suffer from serious diseases due to lack of medical facilities available. Furthermore, the costs of good medical treatments are for many people of Ladakh beyond their capacity to pay.</p>

      <p>To provide free medical care to some of the poorest people and those living in the remotest villages of the Himalayan region, Bhikkhu Sanghasena, a Buddhist leader, meditation teacher, and founder of Mahabodhi International Meditation Centre (MIMC) established the Mahabodhi Karuna Charitable Hospital in 1995, at the Devachan campus of MIMC in Leh, Ladakh. The hospital has been delivering medical treatment for over two decades with the help of senior doctors retired from local government hospitals and visiting volunteer doctors from around the world. Our Mission is to improve the existing medical facilities at the hospital and to serve the people of Ladakh better.</p>

      <p>The public health care system needs to be better structured and resourced and periodically renewed and strengthened to improve the health of the population. A framework needs to be worked out that defines the core activities of a comprehensive public health system. In an attempt to ensure a better health care coverage, Mahabodhi International Mediation Centre (MIMC) has been supplementing the government’s efforts to providing a strong and effective public health services for improving the health of the population.</p>

      <p>Ladakh is the biggest district in India however there is only one hospital at its capital Leh, which is often crowded and lacks modern diagnostic machines and equipment’s. Heart disease is very common in Ladakh, but treatment and facilities are not readily available. Patients are therefore referred either to Chandigarh or to Delhi. Not everyone can afford this expensive treatment. To supplement medical services, and provide quality Medicare, Guruji Ven. Sanghasena Mahanyaka Thera started the Mahabodhi Karuna Charitable Hospital in 1996 by the kind initial support of Mother Park Sung Soo from South Korea. The hospital now has a mobile ambulance, to impart heath care in rural areas.</p> 

      <p>The residence of remote villages otherwise cannot access adequate health care given the geographical isolation, harsh environment and lack of general health education in Ladakh. Outfitted with the latest medical equipment’s among clean, well maintained facilities, the Karuna Hospital continues to set new standards of Health care in the region.</p> 

      <p>The Mahabodhi Hospital organizes annual summer medical camps in remote villages, attended by specialist doctors from our hospital and abroad.</p>

      <p>Health care in the Himalayan region is insufficient and cannot afford to go out of Ladakh for their medical treatment. Many people in the remote areas have serious difficulties about healthcare access and cost. The supply in Ladakh of doctors is very less and many people often suffer or die from lack of proper medical care. Furthermore, the costs of good medical treatments are too high for many people in Ladakh and it is beyond their capacity to pay. Sustained funding to support our hospital would help many people from Leh and Ladakh at low to no cost. For years, Venerable Bhikkhu Sanghasena, the visionary and humble monk who created the MIMC, has dreamt about starting an association that is dedicated to improving the health care system in the Himalayan region. Having already dedicated his life to the care, support and nurturing of the people of Ladakh, he has decided that now is the time to begin this huge undertaking. It is this new act of care and compassion that has brought about the Global Doctor’s Association for the Himalayas.</p>

      <p>Founder of The Global Doctors Association for the Himalayas, Venerable Bhikkhu Sanghasena decided to start this initiative to bring together doctors and medical professionals from around the world to deliver medical care and generate awareness on health and disease prevention in the Himalayas. The sole aim of establishing Global Doctors Association for the Himalayas, is to reach the unreachable and help deliver better medical care to the people of Himalayan region where there is inadequate medical care.

The association intends to organize medical camps for the poorest and the most isolated people in the Himalayan region for primary health check-up, distributing medicines, conducting operations and generating awareness on health and disease prevention.</p>

      <p>The Global Doctors Association has the capacity to change and better the health care facility in the Himalayan region. In the recent times, there has been an increase of health issues that have surfaced itself in the Himalayan regions, particularly in Ladakh. Health problems in Ladakh can be grouped into a few main categories, a high rate, of infectious and water borne diseases, poor environmental sanitation and hygiene, unsatisfactory nutritional status, health education, ignorance about health, and an unsatisfactory health care delivery system.</p>
