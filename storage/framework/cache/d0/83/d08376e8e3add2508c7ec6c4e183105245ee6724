      <p>The Women’s Literacy Project was started in 1998 in the village of Stakmo with an enrollment of 33 learners.</p>

      <p>It was inaugurated by Ven.Sanghasena, under the guidance and supervision of Madam Tsewang Dolma Tsarpa, Madam Tsewang Dolma and Madam Kunzes Dolma.</p>

      <p>After the successful running of the initial project, two more projects were started at Gonpa and Saboo. So far following centres:Stakmo, Gonpa, Saboo, Nurla, Sakti, Stok,Katpa and Diskthtsal or Housing Colony have successfully completed the learning, hence all these centers have closed.
        Today following centers are running in the respective villages: Choglamsar, Palam, Tukla, Yangthang, Saspotse, Ney, Umla, Skalzangling, Sankar, Chubi, Motik Market and Diskittsal.
        These elderly people didn’t get opportunity to go to school in their young age therefore they don’t know reading and writing even local Ladakhi language (Bodyik).
        </p>

        <p>Hence through this project we teach them basic knowledge of reading and writing of Bodyik language together with basic calculation of math.</p>
