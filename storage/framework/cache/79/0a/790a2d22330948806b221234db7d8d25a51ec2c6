      <p>Meditation' is the accepted translation of the Buddhist term 'bhavana' which more accurately means mental culture or mental development. Buddhism is primarily about gaining insight into the true nature of reality and bringing an end to dissatisfaction and suffering in life. The immediate benefits of the practice of meditation is the minimising of restlessness, discontent, fear, aversion and a cultivation of equanimity, acceptance and tranquility. The practice of meditation consciously cultivates and develops the mind to rise above the stresses and insecurities that burden our lives, and generates a richer and deeper experience of life. The highest goal of the practice, however, is gaining permanent release from the unsatisfactory cycle of life. This is the ultimate goal of the Teachings of the Buddha.</p>

      <p>Traditionally, there are two main approaches to Buddhist meditation. The first is calm, samatha, meditation. The purpose is to calm both body and mind; it is to bring the mind into a state of perfect concentration. In a day to day practical sense, samatha helps in greater peace of mind and tolerance for the stresses life puts in our path. Despite these benefits samatha does not offer a complete pathway to enlightenment - a complete release from our restless and discontented selves. Buddha introduced the practice of vipassana - insight - meditation as the critical technique to move us to full entitlement. Vipassana means 'to see things as they really are'. It builds on the positive emotion generated in Samatha, and helps develop awareness into the impermanence and interconnectedness of our experiences.</p>

      <p>At Mahabodhi, the practice and teaching of meditation is one of the main programs. Meditation is introduced to all students and staff of Mahabodhi Devachan. Each year, during the summer months, the MIMC is engaged in conducting several mediation activities targeting visitors. Meditation classes are conducted both at the main campus and at other places in Ladakh.</p>
