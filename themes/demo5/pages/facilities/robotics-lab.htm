      <p>Physics and mathematics often considered as stumbling blocks for students. Many students wonder if they might ever be able to apply the learnings in real life situations. To remove such fear and apprehensions in the children and to make the abstract concepts of mathematics & physics practical to their lives, the shool has set up its Robotics Lab, 1st of its kind in entire Ladakh. At first robotics might seem exotic, but on a closer examination it attracts students to domains such as mechanics, electrical circuits and applied mathematical reasoning. Students learn to transfer their abstract knowledge, gained in maths and physics classes, to a practical level.</p>

      <p>Robotics provides a conducive environment that emphasizes on meaningful problem-based learning, integration and application of knowledge, hands-on learning in cooperative groups and demonstrable mastery of new learning we are the 1st school in entire region to have a Robotics Lab in the school.</p>
