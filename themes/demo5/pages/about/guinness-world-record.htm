      <p>On 10th June, football history was created in Ladakh at Mahabodhi Residential School in an amazing display of endurance and agility. 11 members of the school football team created a new Guinness World Record for the most football penalty taken in 1 hour by a team. In an one-hour endeavour that started at 11:06 A.M at the school grounds, the team scored an astonishing 1,302 penalty kicks, and bettered the previous Guinness World Record of 705 penalty kicks taken by a Brazilian Football Club in Rio De Janiero in October 2016.
